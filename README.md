# hello-world
A qualification of an explorer is not being afraid to get lost.
As a nurse and a social worker, I have the opportunity to get to know others very quickly.  It is nice to use some of my introverted qualities of reflection of self and others to try make things better for us all.  Learning makes me happy, and I am currently working on Spanish, Automation, and Coding.  Enough about me!
